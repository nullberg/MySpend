# Android app: keep track of spendings

## Description

Many apps exist out there to keep track of your spendings. But sometimes simple is better. This Android app was made in straight-forward way, and exports your spending data into a simple TXT file with time-stamps. Just select amount, currency, and category.

Using this code as a template, other users can also fork this project and create their own implementation.

## Example usage

Here is an example of making an entry:

<img src="https://github.com/nullberg/MySpend/blob/master/images/MySpend_entry_example.png" alt="MySpend_entry_example.png" width="600px"/>

The spend entries are stored locally on the phone in <code>/storage/emulated/0/Documents/MySpend/myspend_data.txt</code>. Example contents of this file are shown below from having opened the file with a text editor on the phone:
